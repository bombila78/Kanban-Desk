Kanban-desk Web-application

Language: TypeScript, JavaScript

Technologies: NodeJS, SQL

Frameeorks: ReactJS, ExpressJS

My application presents an upgraded version of well-known ToDo application,
that is widely used in many IT web-development courses nowadays.

User see the steps on the interface and can add new tasks to the "ToDo" step, also he can move his task from
one step to another.

The main feature of my application is an opportunity to move your tasks step by step,
from "ToDo", to "Done". LAter, I amm going to upgrade it with authorisation and opportunity for 
every user to create its custom step for his tasks.

Another feature is additional infromation on every task, different on each step. On step "In process"
the app will show, how long this task is already continued, and on "Done" step you can see the price is cost for you.

I made this application with TypeScript language as on frontend, so on the backend. Data preserves in SQL database, I managed it
with Postgre and sequelize library for NodeJS.
